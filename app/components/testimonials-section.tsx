She didn't just enjoy themâ€”she's grown in confidence, built lasting friendships, and discovered a real passion for volleyball. The group sizes made sure she felt included, the coaches inspired her every step of the way, and the drills and games turned learning into something she looks forward to all week. We've seen such a positive difference in her, both on and off the court.",
